/**
 * DUP-FE-012. The CA detail panel read `ca.days_remaining`, a field the CA
 * serializer never emits (backend/models/ca.py to_dict has valid_from/valid_to
 * but no days_remaining — only Certificate.to_dict has one). `undefined !== null`
 * is true, so the block rendered; every numeric comparison against undefined is
 * false, so it rendered with no colour band and a count of undefined.
 *
 * The helper below recomputes it from `valid_to`, rounding the way the server
 * does, so the CA panel cannot disagree by a day with the certificate panel
 * next to it. That convention is signed and asymmetric (time left rounds up,
 * time past rounds down); it lives in contracts/days_remaining_contract.json,
 * which expiryContract.test.js reads. This file used to pin a floor in both
 * directions, from a time when the server did too.
