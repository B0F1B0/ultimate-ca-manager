"""What forbids deleting a resource, written once for both delete paths.

Every deletable resource is reachable through two routes: `DELETE /<id>` and
`POST /bulk/delete`. They answer differently -- one an HTTP status, the other
a per-item entry in a `failed` list -- but the *question* they ask is the same:
may this row go? Asking it twice is how the two drifted. A template bound to a
SCEP profile was refused by the unit route and deleted by the bulk one, which
left the profile pointing at an id SQLite hands to the next template created.

So the question lives here and the answer is rendered by the caller. A blocker
carries both wordings because the two routes have always phrased them
differently and their clients read those strings; single-sourcing the *set* of
blockers is the point, not re-wording the messages.

The functions are generators: a caller that only needs the first blocker does
not pay for the queries behind the others, which is what the unit routes did
when they checked conditions one at a time.
