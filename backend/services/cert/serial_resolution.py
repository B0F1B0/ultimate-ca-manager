"""The integer serial a stored record actually carries.

``Certificate.serial_number`` has three writers, and the columns copied from
it (``CA.serial_number``, ``RevokedSerial.serial_number``) inherit whichever
one wrote the row:

- decimal, ``str(n)`` — ``services/cert/mixins/lifecycle.py``, the import
  routes, ``api/wstep_protocol.py``, OPNsense and smart import;
- lowercase hex, ``format(n, 'x')`` — ``api/v2/certificates/cert_create.py``,
  ``services/cert/renewal.py``, ``api/v2/policies.py``;
- uppercase hex, ``format(n, 'X')`` — ``api/v2/msca.py``.

Read back, an all-digit column is ambiguous: ``"12345"`` is 12345 for the
first writer and 0x12345 = 74565 for the other two. ``serial_to_int`` answers
decimal first, so a hex writer's serial comes back as some other
certificate's — the CRL then published that other serial and left the revoked
one unlisted, while the OCSP responder, which settles the ambiguity against
the stored certificate, answered ``revoked`` for the real one. Two answers for
one certificate.

The stored certificate settles it: a record holding a PEM knows its own
serial, whatever its column says. Records holding none (``RevokedSerial``,
whose certificate is gone by design) keep the column reading, which is all
there is to read.

Deliberately *not* merged with ``services/ocsp_service._record_holds_serial``:
that one answers a different question (does this record hold *this* serial),
tri-state, and treats an unreadable certificate as "cannot say, accept the
match". Folding it onto this resolver would turn those into a rejection and
change what the responder answers for a row stored without its PEM.
