        Every failure here used to be `pass`: a restore that could not write
        a single file still reported success. Two kinds are distinguished,
        because they do not mean the same thing.

        A write that fails — no space left, a read-only directory — stops the
        restore. It runs inside the transaction, so the rows go back with it
        and the instance stays as it was, which is the only outcome that
        matches what the caller is told.

        The certificate and CSR files are staged rather than written in
        place, and published with the rest once the transaction has
        committed: written directly, a restore that failed afterwards left
        every certificate file holding the archive's content while the rows
        had gone back to what they were. The key mirrors are the exception
        and stay a direct write, because mirroring is also a *removal* when
        database encryption is on, which staging does not express; each one
        is atomic on its own (see ``mirror_private_key``).

        Material that cannot be decoded is a warning naming the row, and the
        restore goes on. This walks every authority and certificate in the
        database, not only the ones the archive carried: a row whose stored
        key predates this installation's KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY was already
        unreadable before the restore, so nothing is lost by not mirroring
        it, and refusing would make an instance holding one such row
        impossible to restore at all. What the archive itself brought cannot
        land here: it was just encoded by this process, a few lines above.
