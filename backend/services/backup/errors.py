"""Errors raised while building a backup archive.

An archive that is missing a section, or that carries a key nobody can
decrypt, is not a backup: it is a file that will only reveal what it lost on
the day it is restored. Every such condition aborts the backup with one of
these errors instead of being downgraded to a log line.

    underlying driver error, and is safe to return to the caller.
