"""What a backup setting may hold, decided in one place.

Frequency and retention reached the database through two routes that did not
agree on what was legal: the dedicated schedule route bounded both, General
settings took any string for the frequency and any value at all for the
retention, and reading the schedule back quietly substituted a default for
whatever had been stored. A cadence the scheduler does not know became "daily"
without anyone being told, and a retention of ``null`` became 30 days on one
screen and nothing at all on another.

A value this product refuses is refused where it is written, by these
functions, with a message that names the rule. What is stored is therefore
always something the scheduler can run, and reading it back needs no
correction.
