"""What a restore has to tell the operator, beyond that it worked.

Two facts an archive can carry are useless in a log and necessary in the
answer: a record whose stored private key is not its certificate's, which the
export records deliberately rather than refusing to be taken, and sections the
archive holds that this version does not apply.

Written once because there are two ways to ask for a restore, and each time
the two drifted apart it was the operator who lost: the same archive, restored
from one page or the other, said different things about itself.

    The joining is here rather than at each caller because the two messages
    are punctuated differently: one ends with a full stop and the other does
    not, so appending a clause that begins with one produced `again.. 1
    record(s)...` on one side and read correctly on the other.

    Only one full stop is removed, and only a full stop. Stripping every
    trailing one turned an ellipsis into a single dot, and adding one
    unconditionally gave `Did it work?.` to anything ending in a question or
    an exclamation mark. No caller writes either today; this is the joint
