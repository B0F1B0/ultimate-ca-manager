"""Extended restore methods mixin for BackupService.

Every section here is applied through `apply_columns`, from the manifest the
export was written from. The hand-written assignments it replaces had the
same two faults throughout:

* they wrote a hand-picked list of columns, and only onto rows they were
  creating -- an SSH authority, a Microsoft connector, a scan profile or an
  HSM key this installation already had was counted as restored and left
  exactly as it was, and `microsoft_cas.winrm_password` was on no list at
  all, so the WinRM credential was lost at every restore;
* they wrote the source's own numeric ids into foreign keys --
  `ssh_certificates.ssh_ca_id`, `hsm_keys.provider_id`,
  `ssh_cas.owner_group_id` -- and counted on `relink_references`, at the very
  end of the restore, to point them at the right row. SQLite enforces no
  foreign key, so the repair arrived in time and nobody was any the wiser;
  PostgreSQL refuses the insert as it happens, and the whole restore with it.

References are resolved where the row is written instead, against a plan
re-indexed for the sections this one points at (`reindex_reference_targets`).
