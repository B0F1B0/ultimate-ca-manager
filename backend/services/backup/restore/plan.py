Two questions are answered here, on the archive alone and on the target's
current state, never by writing: is every row of every section something this
version can apply, and which target row does each archived row and each
archived reference correspond to.

The second question is the one the old restore got wrong in the way that
hurts most quietly: it wrote the source's numeric ids into the target, so a
group membership, an API key or a client certificate could land on whichever
user happened to hold that id here.
