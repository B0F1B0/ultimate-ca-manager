"""What a restore leaves valid behind it: open sessions and warm caches.

A restore replaces the identities (accounts, password hashes, API keys,
client certificates) and the PKI (CA keys, templates, revocations) with the
ones the archive carries. The running process notices none of it: a browser
session opened before the restore still resolves to a user id that now
belongs to somebody else, and the process-level caches keep answering with
the state that was just replaced -- upstream ACME directories, parsed CRL
entries, cached OCSP responses signed by a key this instance no longer has.

So once the transaction has committed and the files are published, the
sessions are revoked and the caches dropped. The two are not equally
negotiable:

- A session that survives a restore is an access granted under identities
  the instance no longer has. Failing to revoke one is a security outcome,
  not a degraded one, so a failure here is raised and the restore cannot be
  reported as clean.
- A cache that survives is a stale answer with a bounded lifetime. Failing
  to drop one must neither stop the other purges nor turn a successful
  restore into an error: each purge is isolated, a failure is logged, and
  only the caches that were really dropped are reported.

The restart is asked for last and only when the caller asks for it, through
``utils.service_manager`` -- the one mechanism that works across packagings
(systemd, DEB/RPM, container) and needs no privilege of its own. A restart
is what makes the guarantee whole: this process can only clear the caches it
holds itself, while the other workers of the same install hold their own.
