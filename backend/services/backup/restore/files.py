"""Files a restore writes, staged until the transaction has committed.

The restore wrote the key mirrors and the server's HTTPS pair in the middle
of its database writes, which left two failures with nothing to repair them:
a transaction that rolled back afterwards kept the files of a restore that
never happened, and a file that could not be written left a database already
partly committed.

Content is staged in a private directory while the transaction can still
fail, and no destination is touched before the commit. Publication is then
one atomic replace per file, and what each destination held is kept until
the last one is published: a failure halfway through puts back what the
earlier replaces overwrote, rather than leaving the instance with half of a
restore's files.
