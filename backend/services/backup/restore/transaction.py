"""One transaction for a whole restore.

The restorers were written to commit as they went, which is why a failure in
a late section left everything before it applied. Rather than rewrite all of
them at once, their commits become flushes for the duration of the restore:
the work reaches the session, stays invisible to everyone else, and is either
committed once at the end or rolled back whole.

A rollback asked for by a restorer is neutralised for the same reason: it
would silently undo the sections that came before it. Errors propagate.
