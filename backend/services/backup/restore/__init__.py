"""Restoring an archive, in phases that cannot half-happen.

The restore used to interleave reading, deciding and writing: entities were
committed before the sections that depend on them were even parsed, so a bad
row in a late section left the instance half-restored, and the numeric ids of
the source were written as if they meant something here.

The phases are now separate, and in this order:

1. decrypt and check what the archive says about itself (container, schema)
2. validate every section and every row, touching nothing
3. build the plan: which target row each archived row is, which target id
   each reference resolves to
4. apply, in one transaction, with files staged but not published
5. publish the files, then invalidate what the restore made stale

Phases 1 to 3 write nothing, so anything they refuse leaves the instance
exactly as it was.
