"""Applying a section, from the same manifest the export was written from.

The old restore set a hand-picked subset of fields, and only on rows it
decided to create: restoring over an existing certificate left its subject,
serial, validity and SANs as they were, so a restore could leave an instance
that matched neither the archive nor its previous state. Here every column the
archive carries is applied, to a row that already exists exactly as to a row
being created, and the references are the ones the plan resolved rather than
the source's numeric ids.

Secrets go back through the model's property, not the column: the property is
what re-encrypts them with *this* installation's key, which is what makes an
archive restorable somewhere else at all.
