"""What has to happen once a restore has been applied, for either route.

There are two ways to ask for a restore and they had drifted apart on every
step after the archive was read: one recorded the restore in a way that could
turn a success into a failure, one asked the service to restart and the other
told the operator to do it themselves, and only one of them handed back what
the archive had said about itself.

The steps live here so that the page an operator happened to use stops
deciding what their restore does.
