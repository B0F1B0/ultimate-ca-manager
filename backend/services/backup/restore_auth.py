"""Authentication-related restore methods mixin for BackupService.

Every section here is applied through `apply_columns`, from the manifest the
export was written from. Two things the hand-written assignments got wrong are
what this file exists to stop doing:

* the secrets were assigned to the *private column* underneath the property
  (`sso._oauth2_client_secret = ...`), which is the column the property
  encrypts into -- so a restored SSO provider held its OAuth2 client secret
  and its LDAP bind password in the clear, and restoring a backup quietly
  removed the at-rest protection of the installation that took it;
* everything the list did not name was dropped: an SSO provider came back
  without its issuer, its JWKS URI, its TLS verification settings or its
  required groups, and an HSM provider had its live `status` reset to
  'unknown' while the target was talking to it.

`plan` is what turns a reference into the row it names *here*; the restore
hands its own down. A section the manifest declares no reference for never
asks the plan anything, so those restorers fall back to an empty plan when
they are called directly.
