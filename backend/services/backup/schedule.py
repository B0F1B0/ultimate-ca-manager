"""Scheduled backup support.

Runs unattended encrypted backups when due, applies retention, and lists
backup history from disk.

``auto_backup_enabled``, ``backup_frequency`` (daily/weekly/monthly),
``backup_retention_days`` and ``backup_password``. There is no time-of-day in
the UI, so cadence is driven by a stored ``backup.last_run`` timestamp.
