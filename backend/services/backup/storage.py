"""Writing a backup archive to disk, and proving what was written.

Structure cannot prove that an archive is restorable: the header of a
truncated or half-overwritten container still parses, and nothing short of the
backup password can check the payload. What can be proven is that the bytes on
disk are the bytes the service produced, so every archive written here is read
back and recorded with its size and SHA-256. Retention protects the most
recent file that still matches its record.
