"""Policy-related restore methods mixin for BackupService.

Every section here is applied through `apply_columns`, from the manifest the
export was written from. The hand-written assignments it replaces had two
faults, and the second one is the reason an archive restored on one backend
and not on the other:

* a row already here had a hand-picked list of columns written onto it, and
  the references were not on the list: a policy kept the authority, the
  template and the approval group the target happened to point at while
  taking the archive's name, rules and approval settings -- a policy
  governing an issuance nobody asked it to govern. An ACME domain kept the
  DNS provider it had here, whatever the archive said;
* a row being created was written with the *source's* numeric ids
  (`certificate_policies.ca_id`, `acme_domains.dns_provider_id`) and left
  `relink_references` to repair them at the very end of the restore. SQLite
  enforces no foreign key, so the repair arrived in time and nobody was any
  the wiser; PostgreSQL refuses the insert as it happens, and the whole
  restore with it.

References are resolved where the row is written, against a plan re-indexed
for the sections this one points at: `certificate_policies` points at
authorities, templates and groups the same restore has just created, and
`acme_domains` at a DNS provider restored three lines above.

`credentials` is assigned by its manifest name, which is the model's own
property: it re-encrypts with this installation's database key, where writing
the column underneath would have left the DNS credentials readable.
