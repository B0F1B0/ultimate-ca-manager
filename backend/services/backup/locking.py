"""One backup operation at a time, across every worker process.

Three paths create, validate or delete archives: the scheduled task (which
wakes every 60 seconds), the "run now" button, and retention (a daily task
plus an on-demand route). Nothing serialised them, so two runs could pick the
same filename within the same second, delete what the other was still reading
back, and both record a success. UCM runs under gunicorn with several
workers, so an in-memory lock would only serialise the threads of one of
them: the exclusion has to live in the filesystem, which is what every worker
shares.

The mechanism itself is ``utils.process_lock``, shared with the database
migration lock. What belongs here is only what is specific to backups: where
the lock file lives, and the exception a refused caller sees.
