"""What both ACME clients do to talk to a CA they did not choose.

UCM speaks ACME as a client twice: ``acme_client_service`` orders its own
certificates, and ``acme_proxy_service`` relays a local client's order upstream.
The two grew the same pieces separately and ended up with one each:

- the outbound URL guard was written twice, byte for byte;
- the nonce reserve and the badNonce retry (RFC 8555 §6.5) existed only on the
  proxy side, so a badNonce was a hard failure for the client;
- the newNonce backoff existed only on the client side, so one slow upstream
  HEAD failed a proxied request outright;
- and each fetched its nonce on a hard-coded timeout -- 30 on one side, 15 on
  the other -- while the operator's configured HTTP timeout sat unused.

The pieces live here so both callers get all of them.
