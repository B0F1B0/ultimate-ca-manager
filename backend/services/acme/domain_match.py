"""Which registered entry covers a domain.

Two tables map a domain to what should issue for it: ``acme_local_domains``
for the internal ACME server, ``acme_domains`` for DNS-provider issuance.
Both accept a wildcard spelling on the way in, and neither could ever find one
again: the lookup stripped the wildcard from the domain it was asked about and
then compared the result to the stored text, so an entry registered as
``*.custom`` matched nothing at all, not even ``*.custom`` itself, and every
order for that zone fell through to the default CA (#352).

The two halves disagreed rather than one of them being wrong: the validator
accepts ``*.local`` on purpose, so the lookup is what has to understand it.
