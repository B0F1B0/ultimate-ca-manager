"""What an ACME order may name, judged once for both front doors.

UCM answers ACME on two paths: its own server (`api/acme/acme_api.py`), which
issues from a local authority, and the proxy (`api/acme/acme_proxy_api.py`),
which relays to an upstream CA and answers the dns-01 challenge itself. Both
take an `identifiers` array straight from an unauthenticated client.

The syntax check lived on the server only. On the proxy the value went
unexamined into `AcmeClientOrder.domains` and into the DNS provider API as a
record name, and was forwarded verbatim upstream. That is the difference this
module removes: the rules are here, and both doors call them.

The rules are the server's, unchanged. They are syntax, not policy: a name
is refused for carrying a port, userinfo, a scheme, a path, whitespace, an
over-long label or an empty one, never for pointing somewhere private.
`localhost`, `host-1.internal.lan` and RFC1918 targets stay acceptable at
order time -- UCM is deployed on LAN and those are the ordinary case. Whether
a *challenge* may be fetched from a given address is a separate decision, made
later and with the deliberately permissive helpers in
`utils/ssrf_protection.py`.
