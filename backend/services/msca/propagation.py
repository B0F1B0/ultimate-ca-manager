"""Carrying a local revocation through to the Windows CA that issued it.

Revoking a certificate UCM obtained from a Microsoft CA is two writes: the
row here, and ``certutil -revoke`` on the issuing CA. Only the second one is
visible to a relying party. Such a certificate has no ``caref`` — UCM is not
its issuer — so UCM publishes neither a CRL entry nor an OCSP answer for it,
and the Windows CA's own CRL is the only place its revocation can appear.

This step lived in the single-certificate route, as a function returning a
Flask response, so the bulk route could not reuse it and did not. A bulk
revoke of a Microsoft CA certificate therefore flipped three columns in UCM's
database, answered ``N certificates revoked``, and left the certificate valid
everywhere it is actually checked. The renewal path does not have that
problem because its Microsoft CA guard sits in the shared service
(``services/cert/renewal.check_renewable``), which is where this now sits too.

The route keeps its own job: turning an outcome into the HTTP response, with
the wording and the ``meta`` keys clients already read.
