"""
Database Admin — entry control for a backend migration.

A migration copies every row of the live database into another one. Two
questions decide whether that is safe, and both are answered here, before the
first INSERT:

  * is the target acceptable — empty, and either bare or carrying exactly the
    UCM schema and nothing else;
  * what exactly gets copied — a plan that either covers every table and every
    column of the source, or does not exist at all.

The rule throughout is that the answer to both is a yes/no, never a "mostly".
The migration this module guards used to accept a target holding certificates,
templates or HSM keys as long as ``users`` and ``certificates`` were empty (it
also probed a table named ``cas``, which has never existed — the table is
``certificate_authorities``, so that third probe was always a no-op), and it
logged a warning for a source table the target did not have, dropped columns
the target did not have, and still reported success. Silent partial copies are
the failure mode worth preventing: the operator switches the backend, the app
comes up, and the missing rows are only discovered much later, after the
source has moved on.

So every check here is fail-closed. An inspection that raises, a COUNT that
cannot run, a table whose name we cannot safely quote — all refusals. Nothing
is ever assumed empty or assumed copyable. The single exception is written
down, column by column and with a reason, in :data:`LEGACY_COLUMNS`.

Messages raised by :class:`PreflightError` travel to the API. They name tables
and columns, because that is what the operator needs to act on, and they never
carry a filesystem path or a connection URI: driver text goes through
``_short_err`` (which redacts credentials) and names coming from the database
go through ``_display``.

    be a running tally of tables skipped and columns dropped — filled in as the
    copy went, and reported alongside a success — is gone: anything that cannot
    be copied is decided here, before the first INSERT. A source table the
    target does not have, a source column the target does not have, a metadata
    table the source does not have, a name that cannot be quoted: each refuses
    the migration while the source is still untouched and the operator can fix
    the target.

    Tables come back parents-first, so the copy satisfies foreign keys even
    when FK enforcement cannot be turned off (a non-superuser PostgreSQL role
    cannot set ``session_replication_role``). The order is taken from the
    TARGET, because the target's constraints are the ones that will be
    enforced: SQLite cannot add a foreign key to a table it has already
    created, so a constraint introduced after an installation was built
    exists in the models and on every PostgreSQL target, and nowhere in that
    installation's own schema. Ordering by the source would then insert a
    child before its parent and PostgreSQL would refuse the row — halfway
    through the copy, after the whole table had been read. Any table the
    sort leaves out is appended rather than dropped: a sort that degraded
    must not quietly shrink the plan.

    The one exception is :data:`LEGACY_COLUMNS`: a column the models dropped
    long ago, whose replacement holds the same information, and whose loss
    someone wrote down. Everything else the target cannot hold stops the
    migration. :func:`dropped_columns` reports what that exception actually
    cost on this source, so the operator reads it rather than guesses it.

    A source table outside ``db.metadata`` that the target also has is copied
    as-is. It is operator data on an operator-controlled database, and
    refusing to carry it over would lose it just as surely as the old skip did.

    The approval in :data:`LEGACY_COLUMNS` is a standing one; this is what it
    costs on the database actually being migrated. Only columns this source
    really has, and that the target really lacks, are reported — an entry for
    a column a more recent installation never had would otherwise announce a
    loss that did not happen.

    Each entry carries the reason and the number of rows where the column is
    not NULL, because that is the difference between an approval and a
    rubber stamp: three of these columns were replaced by a column that was
    added empty, so on an old installation they are the only copy of what
    they hold, and an operator deserves to see "12 values" rather than a
    sentence. A count that cannot be taken is reported as unknown rather than
    as zero: this is the one number nobody should be reassured about by
    accident.
