"""Reading the source once, consistently, without holding it in memory.

Two defects lived in the copy loop. It read every table with
``list(src.execute(...).mappings())``, so a table of half a million
certificates became half a million dictionaries in the worker's heap before a
single row reached the target. And it read those tables one after another
while the instance kept serving requests, so a certificate issued between the
read of ``certificate_authorities`` and the read of ``certificates`` arrived
on the target without its issuer, or a row was copied twice under two
different identities. Nothing in the result said so.

Both are answered by the same idea: decide *what* is being copied before
copying it. On SQLite that is the snapshot file the migration has already
taken and verified — a consistent image by construction, and reading it does
not lock the database the application is still writing to. On PostgreSQL it
is a single ``REPEATABLE READ`` transaction, which is the server's own way of
saying the same thing. Rows are then streamed out of that view and inserted
in batches, so memory stays flat whatever the size of the installation.

    On SQLite the verified snapshot is opened read-only. It is the same file
    the migration would roll back to, so what lands on the target is exactly
    what the rollback point holds — and the live database is never locked.

    On PostgreSQL the live database is read inside one ``REPEATABLE READ``
    transaction: every statement in it sees the database as of the first one,
    concurrent commits included or excluded as a whole. The dump taken
    earlier is a separate image, taken slightly before; that is not a
    contradiction, because the dump exists to restore the *source*, which
    this transaction never writes to.

    The view covers the rows, not the catalogue: the copy plan is built from
    a separate connection, before the first read establishes the snapshot. A
    schema change landing in that gap is not something this guards against —
    UCM runs its schema migrations at startup, not while serving.
