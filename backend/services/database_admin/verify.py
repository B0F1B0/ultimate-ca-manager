"""
Database Admin — post-copy verification of a backend migration.

A copy that raised nothing is not a copy that may be switched to. The loader
inserts with foreign keys disabled (``session_replication_role='replica'`` on
PostgreSQL, ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF`` on SQLite) and leaves the target's
sequences wherever ``CREATE TABLE`` left them, so the failures that matter are
exactly the ones it cannot see: a table short of rows, an orphan no INSERT ever
checked, a duplicate a unique index would have refused, a sequence that hands
the next INSERT a primary key that already exists. Encrypted columns add a
second class of silent loss — bytes, memoryview and text cross the two drivers
differently, and a private key or an integration secret that no longer decrypts
copies as a perfectly valid row.

Everything here reads the TARGET only. The source kept serving requests while
the copy ran, so re-reading it would compare against a database that has since
moved; what the copy actually observed is passed in as ``expected_counts``.

A check that cannot run is a failure. "Could not verify" and "verified" must
never reach the operator as the same answer: that answer authorises switching
the whole installation onto the target.

    the database itself would have refused. Re-enabling enforcement afterwards
