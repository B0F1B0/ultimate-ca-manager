"""
Database Admin — publish DATABASE_URL into /etc/ucm/ucm.env.

``ucm.env`` is shared installation state: besides DATABASE_URL it carries the
key-encryption key, the listen address, the HTTPS port and whatever else the
package or the operator put there. Rewriting it with ``Path.write_text``
truncates the file before the new bytes land, so a crash, a full disk or a
kill at the wrong moment takes every other variable with it.

Everything here therefore goes through a temporary file in the same directory,
fsync'd, given the original mode and owner, then moved over the target with
``os.replace``. A concurrent reader sees either the whole old file or the whole
new one, never a truncated one. The file is read back afterwards to prove what
actually landed on disk, and the previous content is kept in an ``EnvBackup``
so the caller can undo the change when it cannot follow through — typically
when the restart that would make the new URL effective cannot be requested.

Comments are preserved, including a commented-out ``#DATABASE_URL=``: dotenv
never acts on it, so removing it would destroy operator history for no gain.
