"""Stage an audit entry inside the caller's transaction, sealed.

`AuditService.log_action` commits the session it is given, which is the right
thing for a route that has finished its work and the wrong thing for one in
the middle of a transaction it means to commit itself. Eight places therefore
built an `AuditLog` by hand and added it to the session.

All eight forgot the same thing: the seal. `prev_hash` and `entry_hash` were
left empty, and `verify_integrity` skips an entry carrying no hash and
restarts its chain there, so every one of those rows was a gap the
verification walked across while reporting a valid ledger. Eight copies of an
entry, eight copies of the omission.

This is the one way to put an entry in the session without committing it.
