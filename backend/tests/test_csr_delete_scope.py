"""What the CSR routes are allowed to delete.

A certificate signing request and an issued certificate are the same table and
the same counter of identifiers: a CSR is a row whose `csr` is set and whose
`crt` is not. The certificate route refuses to delete a valid, unrevoked
certificate with a 409, so the CRL and the responder keep reflecting it. The
CSR routes called the deletion service straight, with no such check, under a
permission the certificate route does not ask for.

The result was an effective escalation: the `operator` role holds
`delete:csrs` and not `delete:certificates`, so the refusal it is given on one
route was handed to it on the other, and a valid certificate left the instance
without the revocation list ever learning of it.
