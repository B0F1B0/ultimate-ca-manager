"""Deleting a certificate leaves the database and the disk agreeing.

The order was: detach the foreign keys other tables hold on this certificate,
delete its files, write the audit entry, then delete the row and commit.

Writing the audit entry commits the session it is given and rolls all of it
back when it cannot write its own. Called there, it undid the detachment that
had not been committed yet, **after** the files were already gone. The delete
that followed then hit the foreign keys it had just un-detached, so the row
survived with no certificate, no request and no key on disk.

The files are still removed before the commit, which is its own question; what
this pins is that an audit entry never decides the outcome.
