"""What a backup does with key material it cannot simply copy.

Two cases have nothing to do with the ordinary path and everything to do with
whether a restored installation can sign:

  * a certificate authority whose private key lives in an HSM has no key of
    its own to carry. What has to survive is the link: the provider, its
    credentials, and which key of that provider is this authority's. The link
    is a numeric id on the source and means nothing on the target, so it
    travels by identity like every other relation.

  * a record whose stored private key is not its certificate's. Refusing to
    back it up would leave an administrator unable to save the state they
    need to repair, so the archive records it instead. What nobody did was
    say so on the way back in: the restore produced an authority that signs
    answers nobody can verify, and reported a clean success.
