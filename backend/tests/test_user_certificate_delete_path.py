"""Deleting a user certificate deletes what the certificate owns.

The route removed the `Certificate` row with a bare `session.delete`: the
files stayed on disk, the approval requests, deploy bindings and ACME orders
kept pointing at a row that was gone, and the revocation records kept a
dangling foreign key that PostgreSQL refuses outright.

Removing the enrolment withdraws access to UCM and nothing more: the
certificate stayed valid for every other service trusting the same authority.
It is revoked on the way out, so the withdrawal reaches the CRL and the
responder, and the operator still has a single gesture.
