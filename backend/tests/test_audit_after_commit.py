"""An audit entry is written last, once the change it describes is durable.

`AuditService.log_action` commits the session it is given, and rolls all of it
back when it cannot write its own entry. Called anywhere other than last, it
is therefore the call that decides whether the business change survives, and
the caller answers the client with a success for something that has just been
undone.

The order has to hold in both directions:

* A change already staged when the audit fires rides on the audit's commit.
  The entry is what makes it durable, and an entry that cannot be written
  takes it back down with it.
* A change staged *after* the audit is described by an entry that is already
  durable. The audit says the thing happened; the commit that was supposed to
  make it happen can still fail. `services/ca/ca_crud.py` read that way: the
  files were already deleted from disk, the entry said the authority was
  deleted, and only then did the row go.

Nineteen places had it one way or the other and were corrected one at a
time: five deployment routes, two CRL configuration routes, generating a CRL
and a delta CRL, installing an externally signed one, deleting a certificate,
deleting a certificate authority, two ACME authorization paths, a webhook
refusal and a Microsoft CA refusal that each recorded the very request they
were refusing, an SSO role synchronisation that wrote the change down before
making it, a bundle import whose audit committed the caller's whole bundle,
and the two deployment paths that recorded a push already made on a remote
host before the record of it was safe.

Correcting them one at a time does not stop the twentieth. This does, as far
as it reaches: a scan cannot see an audit reached through a variable, and it
reads the thirteen largest functions in these zones by statement order alone
rather than by path. What it does cover is every shape the nineteen took.

The alternative was to change `log_action` so that it stops committing its
caller's session. That changes the meaning of 324 call sites at once, several
of which have no other commit and rely on it. The property is cheaper to
state here: capture what the entry needs, commit, then record.
