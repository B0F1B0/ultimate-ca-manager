"""Hostile archives, past the framing: what a chosen file does to the reader.

`tests/test_backup_container.py` stops at the container — the framing, the KDF
profile, the compression bomb, the schema an archive announces about itself.
This file picks up where the container is well-formed and the payload is not:
a file that stops in the middle, a section that is not the shape it claims to
be, a row nothing can identify, an archive that carries nothing at all, and a
field holding a value no column can take.

Three things are asked of every case here, and they are the reason the file
exists rather than the individual inputs:

* the refusal is explicit and names what it is about, so an administrator can
  act on it instead of retyping the password;
* nothing reaches the caller that it should not — no traceback, no driver
  error, no internal path;
* the instance is exactly as it was, which is checked by counting rows before
  and after rather than by trusting the refusal.

The archives are built from this installation (`_forged`, as in
test_backup_restore_failfast), carrying one section: the suite's database is
shared by every file of a worker, so an archive of everything would rewrite
rows other files are watching.
