"""A role change is recorded once it has been made, not before.

`_get_or_create_sso_user` synchronises the role an identity provider reports
onto the local account. The entry saying the role changed used to be written
before the assignment and before the commit, and `AuditService.log_action`
commits the session it is given: the entry decided whether the identity
binding made a few lines above survived, while the assignment it described
had not happened yet.

Two things are pinned here: the entry names the change that was actually
made, and it is not written at all when the change is rolled back.
