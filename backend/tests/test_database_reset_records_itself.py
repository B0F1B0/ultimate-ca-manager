"""A database reset leaves a record of itself, in the database it recreates.

The route imported a function that does not exist, so it answered 500 and
reset nothing on every call. Made to work again, it then had a subtler
problem: the entry was written after `drop_all` and `create_all`, which is
the only place it can survive, but it was attributed by looking the actor up
on `g.current_user`. That instance is expired by then and its row has just
been destroyed, so the lookup raised, `log_action` swallowed it and wrote
nothing, and the route still answered "Database reset successfully".

It looked right in testing only because the administrator running the reset
is usually the one the reset recreates, who comes back with the same row.
