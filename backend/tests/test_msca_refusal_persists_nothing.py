"""A refused connection update keeps nothing it was asked to change.

The fields of a Microsoft CA connection are applied to the row one at a time
with no commit between them. A value of the wrong type part way down raises,
and the route answers 500 with the earlier fields still staged.

That was harmless until the refusal was audited, because nothing committed.
`AuditService.log_action` commits the session it is given, so the audit entry
for the refusal was what made the refused change durable: a request naming a
new server, a new user and a new password, with one field the route cannot
read, was answered "Failed to update connection" and kept the rest.
