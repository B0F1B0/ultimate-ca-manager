"""A fault at every point a backup or a restore can fail, and what stays true.

The other backup tests each pin one mechanism: the transaction, the staged
files, the retention rules, the scheduler's retry guard. This file breaks the
seams *between* them and asks the only question an administrator cares about
afterwards -- what is on this machine now, and does what it is told match it.

So each test injects one failure at one precise point (never a stand-in for
the function under test, which would only prove the stand-in), and then reads
the instance back: it counts the rows, re-reads the files byte for byte with
their mode, looks at what was left in the temporary directories, and checks
what the route or the task reported.

Three properties are the reason the file exists:

- The database is either entirely as it was or entirely the archive's, and
  no file on disk describes a restore that did not happen. The window is the
  commit, and the files are published just before it, so a commit that fails
  has to take the files back with it.
- A failure in what *reports* the work -- the audit trail, the outcome row --
  never changes the verdict on the work itself, in either direction.
- A failure in what *finishes* the work -- retention, the restart signal --
  is told to the operator without pretending the work did not happen.

Every archive here carries only the sections under test (`_only`, the pattern
of test_backup_restore_symmetry): the session database is shared by the whole
file-level worker with no per-test rollback, and a full archive restored into
it would rewrite rows the rest of the suite is looking at. Each test puts the
rows and the files it touched back before it returns.
