"""The service reads the journal it is told to collect, by a grant in the unit.

Both units log to the journal, and the diagnostic bundle collects it with
`journalctl -u ucm`. Reading a system unit's journal requires systemd-journal
membership, and the service user was only ever added to the SoftHSM group, so
`collect_journal` returned nothing and the bundle shipped without the journal
its own description advertises.

The grant is declared in the unit rather than made with a `usermod` at install
time. A group added to the account is held by everything that account ever
runs and survives until someone remembers to take it away; `SupplementaryGroups`
is scoped to this service, visible where the rest of its hardening is, and
revoked by commenting out one line.
