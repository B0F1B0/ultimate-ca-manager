"""Four built-in roles, and every list of them says four.

`auth/permissions.ROLE_PERMISSIONS` defines admin, operator, auditor and
viewer. Three other places restated the list and two of them left `auditor`
out:

* `api/v2/users/management.py` -- the CSV bulk import -- checked against
  three names and **silently rewrote** anything else to `viewer`. An
  operator importing a file of auditors got viewers, with no error and no
  mention in the result. `viewer` has no `read:audit`, so the accounts
  created for people whose job is to read the audit log could not read it.
  The single-user route next door returns a 400 for an unknown role, so the
  same value was refused by one door and quietly changed by another.
* `api/v2/rbac.RESERVED_ROLE_NAMES` also had three, so a **custom** role
  could be created called `auditor`, sitting beside the built-in one of the
  same name. The other three names are refused with a 409.

A role vocabulary is not a matter of taste per file: it is the set the
permission table has entries for.
