"""System log access: the diagnostic bundle download, and reading the tail of
the application log for the log viewer.

The bundle returns a ZIP of the most relevant UCM logs (ucm.log, error.log,
access.log, the last lines of the systemd journal when running under systemd)
plus a small secret-free ``system.txt`` diagnostic. The reader returns the same
application log as records. Sensitive tokens are redacted on both paths, and
both are admin-only (``admin:system``).
