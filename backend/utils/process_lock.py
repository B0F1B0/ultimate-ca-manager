"""One operation at a time, across every worker process.

UCM runs under gunicorn with several workers, so an in-memory lock only ever
serialises the threads of one of them. Operations that must not overlap —
writing a backup archive, migrating the database to another backend — need an
exclusion that lives in the filesystem, which is the one thing every worker
shares.

The lock is advisory (``flock``), held for the whole operation, and keyed by
the file that carries it: a thread already holding one lock must still be
able to take a different one, so the nesting depth is counted per path and
not once for the process.

    ``fail_open`` decides what happens when the lock cannot be taken for a

    flock (NFS without lockd, some SMB mounts). Open, the operation is logged
    as unprotected and allowed through, which is the right trade-off for a
    backup: an installation that can never take one again is a worse failure
    than two overlapping runs. Closed, the operation is refused, which is the
