"""The rule for a password that encrypts an export, in one place.

Six routes hand out an encrypted bundle and each had invented its own rule:
presence only for a certificate's PKCS#12, PFX and JKS; 4 to 256 for a CA's;
8 with three different wordings for the user-certificate, mTLS and
key-recovery routes; presence only again for the converter tool.

The dialog that drives most of them, `components/ExportModal.jsx`, refused
under 8 and knew of no ceiling, so it was stricter than the server on one
route and more permissive on another at the same time. Stricter is a feature
a user cannot reach; more permissive is a refusal they cannot explain. Only
the first can hide something, and it did: a script could encrypt a PKCS#12
with a one-character password through a route the dialog would never send.

* **8** is the floor, because the dialog and half the routes already
  required it, and because a bundle carrying a private key is exactly what a
  brute-force is for.
* **256** is the ceiling, and it is the one bound anybody wrote a reason
  for: `BestAvailableEncryption` and pyjks degrade sharply past a few
  hundred bytes.

An **empty** password is not a short one. On a private-key export it means
"hand it to me unencrypted", which is a deliberate answer; callers that
allow it pass ``allow_empty=True``, and every other caller refuses it.
