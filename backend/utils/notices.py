"""What the server decided differently from what was asked, said out loud.

A request that is neither refused nor honoured as written is the one case a
caller cannot see: the answer is a 200 or a 201, and the difference only shows
up later, in the expiry date of a certificate somebody is relying on. These
notices travel in the response ``meta.notices`` so the interface can show them
next to the result, and read the same way in a log.

They are not errors. A refusal goes through ``error_response``; a notice says
the thing was done, and on what terms.
